Hand Written Digit Classification with CNN

STEPS INVOLVED 

1.Import the libraries (tf and keras) and load the dataset (mnist contains 60,000 training images â€¢10,000 testing images)

2.Reshaping and Normalizing the Images (preprocessing - grayscaling for kerasAPI(0 to 255))

3.Building the Convolutional Neural Network (sequential model : convo2d, maxpool, flatten, dropout, dense)

4.Compiling and training the model ( adam optimizer, sparse categorical cassentropy with relu and softmax) 

5.Evaluating the Model
